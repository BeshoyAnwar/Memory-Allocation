# Contiguous-Memory-Allocation-Algorithms
## Description
Contiguous memory allocation is a classical memory allocation model that assigns a process consecutive memory blocks (that is, memory blocks having consecutive addresses).

The contiguous memory allocation scheme can be implemented in operating systems with the help of two registers, known as the base and limit registers.
### Different Contiguous Memory Allocation Algorithms

#### First Fit
In the first fit approach is to allocate the first free partition or hole large enough which can accommodate the process. It finishes after finding the first suitable free partition.
#### Best Fit
The best fit deals with allocating the smallest free partition which meets the requirement of the requesting process. This algorithm first searches the entire list of free partitions and considers the smallest hole that is adequate. It then tries to find a hole which is close to actual process size needed.
#### Worst fit
In worst fit approach is to locate largest available free portion so that the portion left will be big enough to be useful. It is the reverse of best fit.
